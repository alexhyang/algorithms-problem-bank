/*
 * 27. Remove Element
 * (https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)
 *
 * ============
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of
 * val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return
 * the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
 *
 * Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to
 * get accepted, you need to do the following things:
 *  - Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
 *    elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are
 *    not important as well as the size of nums.
 *  - Return k.
 *
 * ============
 *  Test Cases:
 *  1. general:
 *      nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3 => 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
 *      nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2 => 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
 *
 *  2. no matches:
 *      nums = [3,3,3,3], val = 2 => 4, nums = [3,3,3,3]
 *
 *  3. all matches:
 *      nums = [3,3,3,3], val = 3 => 0, nums = [_,_,_,_]
 *
 *  4. empty nums:
 *      nums = [], val = 3 => 0, nums = []
 *
 *  5. val out of range of nums[i] (val > 50)
 *      nums = [3,3,3,3], val = 51 => 4, nums = [3,3,3,3]
